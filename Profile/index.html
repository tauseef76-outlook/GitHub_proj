                <p>I am a budding self-taught software engineer. My first introduction to programming was
          during college years using C/C++. Following that, I then took this further by learning
          about Data Structures and Algorithm I have since moved on from C/C++, exposing myself
          to a variety of different technologies including JavaScript, Python, and SQL.</p>
          <p>Currently, I am looking to join a dynamic team who are excited about building and
          transforming software, are interested in diversity, have strong work ethics and adopt the
          following practices: pair programming, test driven development, continuous integration,
          frequent releases, user - centered design, fine-grained user stories, refactoring, and
          continuous improvement.</p>
